🚨 SOC Analyst Learning Journey - Day 3 & 4 Notes

✅ Day 3: IP Addressing & Subnetting

🌐 What is an IP Address?

An (IP address)is like the home address of a device on a network. Just like a letter needs an address to reach the correct house, 
data packets need IP addresses to reach the right computer.

Example:-
If you're sending a message on WhatsApp, your message is broken into packets and sent from your device's IP address to your friend’s IP address.
If your IP is wrong, it’s like sending a letter to the wrong house!

### 📘 Types of IP Addresses:

* IPv4:- 32-bit (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
* IPv6:- 128-bit (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

### 📘 Types Based on Usage:

* Private IP:- Used inside a private network (like your home WiFi)
* Public IP:-Used on the internet (your network’s visible address)

### 🧮 What is Subnetting?

**Subnetting breaks a big network into smaller networks. It helps in better security, less traffic, and efficient IP management.

Real Life Analogy:-
Think of a college hostel with 4 floors (subnets). All rooms have unique room numbers (IP addresses), 

but each floor is managed separately. This reduces confusion and makes management easier.

### 📌 Important Terms:

* Subnet Mask:** Helps identify the network and host part of an IP.
* CIDR Notation:** Like 192.168.1.0/24 → Means subnet mask is 255.255.255.0

## ✅ Day 4: What is a SOC?

### 🏢 SOC (Security Operations Center)

A SOC is a centralized place where a team monitors, detects, prevents, and responds to cybersecurity threats in real time.

**Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine a SOC like a CCTV control room in a shopping mall. The security team watches all camera feeds and raises 
alarms when something suspicious is noticed — just like cybersecurity professionals do with network activity.

### 🔧 What Happens Inside a SOC?

* 24/7 Monitoring of logs, network traffic, endpoints
* Threat Detection using tools like SIEM (e.g., Splunk, QRadar)
* Incident Response – Act quickly when something bad happens
* Vulnerability Management – Finding weak spots in systems before attackers do

### 👨‍💻 SOC Team Structure:

1. Level 1 Analyst (L1): First line of defense, monitors alerts, triages issues.
2. Level 2 Analyst (L2): Deep dives into alerts, runs investigations.
3. Level 3 Analyst (L3): Threat hunting, advanced analysis, and remediation.
4. SOC Manager:** Oversees everything, coordinates between teams.

### 🔍 Key Tools Used:

* SIEM Tools: Splunk, IBM QRadar, ELK Stack
* EDR: Crowdstrike, SentinelOne
* Firewall/IDS/IPS: Palo Alto, Snort, Suricata

### 📈 Why is SOC Important?

* Detects cyber threats in real-time
* Protects sensitive data
* Reduces downtime and financial loss
